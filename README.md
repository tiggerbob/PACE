### Decoder for a specific type of encoded text ;)

*NOTE:* For a selection of text, name the file "read.txt" (or edit the source code, init.py, directly) so that the script may read it without error.   
#### Parameters
* Word step (ex: a step of 2 would skip over every other word; a step of -1 would list every word except in reverse order, etc.) 
* Character count (character count of the secret message, starts at 0)  

Example  
**Text:** `Horribly, everyone laughed lightly over Wendy's orchestrated return, like dolls.`  
  
**Parameters:**  
*Step:* 1  
*Character count:* 10  
  
**Result:** `HELLOWORLD`
